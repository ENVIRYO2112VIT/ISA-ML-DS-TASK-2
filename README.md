# ISA ML AND DS TASK 2

THIS CONTAINS SOME BASIC IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR PANDAS IN PYTHON
THIS IS A PART OF MY ML AND DATA SCIENCE DOMAIN TASKS IN ISA-VIT CLUB

1. THE TASK2.docx FILE CONSISTS OF THE OPERATIONS OR THE IMPLEMENTATIONS DONE USING PANDAS LIBRARY OF PYTHON,THE FILE ALSO CONTAINS THE DATASET FOR THE SAME
2. THE TASKS ARE SPLIT IN THE FORM OF "LEVELS",SO ARE THE CODES IN TASK_2_20BCI0112_FINAL.py ,SO ITS BETTER TO KEEP BOTH FILES OPEN SIDE BY SIDE.

HOPE YOU GET SOME GOOD BOOST AFTER SEEING THIS REPO
